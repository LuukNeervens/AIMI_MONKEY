## About

Detailed description of the project.  
Explain the motivation, what problem it solves, and why itâ€™s useful.

## Usage

The final product was implemented utilizing two notebooks: 
1. patch_extraction.ipynb
2. pipeline.ipynb

`patch_extraction.ipynb` was utilized to obtain extract the patches (both for train and test) out of the original .tif files. In the top of this notebook 

```bash
# Example for Python
pip install project-name
